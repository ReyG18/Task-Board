# Task-Board

## Description

A simple task board for managing project tasks where users will be able to:

-- Input the title of the project, due date, and description into a form
that, on submit, will display a project card containing each input.

-- Drag and drop each project card into a column that specifies if the project is on the todo list, is in progress, or done.

-- Delete a project card on button click.

## Known Bugs

-- Project cards drag, but do not drop.
-- Delete button is not functional.
-- Project card displays improperly.

## Upcoming Features

As this task board is still currently in development, the following features will be added soon:

-- Project cards will display in the Todo column by default.
-- Card styling: Each project card will change color depending on its state.
-- Project cards and their states will save to localStorage, allowing users to close the browser and return where they left off.
